# KMeans Clustering on Image, Audio, and Text Data

This repository contains python code to extract feature data from three types of dataset and perform KMeans Clustering on each of the dataset.

Feature data was extracted from the following datasets:
- MNIST (Images of handwritten numerical digits)
- GTZAN Dataset (Songs divided into 10 genres of music)
- Reddit Comments Dataset (Text data of comments made on popular subreddits)

For the GTZAN Dataset, I have also performed MFCC and Filter Bank extraction to extract features of each song.
